This is a draft, since class is starting in 30 minutesâ€¦ ðŸ˜…


## Everything I teach

Previous edition of my courses can be found under [didactics](didactics).


## Searching Twitter

To know my thoughts on SVD search for `(from:alfcnz) SVD` on Twitter.\
Another examples:
 - `(from:alfcnz) linear algebra`;
 - `(from:alfcnz) probability data science`.

If you become a follower, you'll be automatically notified with new learning visual content.


## Maths

Is your maths a little rusty?
No problem.
Check out Marc's book [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/).
You really want to check out Chapter 5, Vector Calculus.


### Linear algebra

Please, binge watch [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=AdcNsCBGyU0nNLKh) by Grant.
This is a *requirement*.


## Blogs


### Shameless plug

Do eigenvectors need to be orthogonal?
(You keep giving me the wrong answer. Yann includedâ€¦)\
May be worth checking out [Eigen-stuff]({% post_url 2021-08-23-eigen-stuff %}).


### Gregory

His [blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/) is stellar.
I recommend particulary:

 1. [Singular Value Decomposition as Simply as Possible](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/12/10/svd/) and
 2. [A Geometrical Understanding of Matrices](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/10/24/matrices/).


## Network drawing software

[Draw.io](https://draw.io/) is what I use to draw my slides' diagrams with.
It could be a useful tool for you too.
