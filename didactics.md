I'm devoted to free education and I'm teaching via Twitter (blog) and YouTube (video).
Over the course of the years I've been creating several resources translated in over 15 languages.
I've just finished pushing online the Spring 2021 edition of the NYU Deep Learning course.
Finally, I'm writing a textbook with Mikael Henaff and Yann LeCun.

You can read more about my teaching philosophy and methods in [this article](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3jKiduENcO).
