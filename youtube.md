## NYU Deep Learning Fall 2022 selection

One more semester, one more update for the course content, mostly driven by the book writing process.
Meaning, while writing down the lecture notes, I inevitably use extra care to better explain the concepts, therefore crafting new illustrations and examples.
Below you can find a playlist containing the latest edition of my lectures.
For missing videos, please fall back to the Spring 2021 edition.
Use the [NYU-DLFL22](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLFL22/) website to navigate these episodes.

## NYU Deep Learning Spring 2020

First time the material was ready for the public.
Started in person and later went online because of [CoViD-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19).
(First time using [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) extensively.)
This edition has [lecture notes](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP20/) translated in over 15 languages by over 500 volunteers.
Captions: ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.

## How to prepare a presentation

If you need to present something to me, **do** watch this video first, so that we can focus on feedback on *your* content and not on the form.
